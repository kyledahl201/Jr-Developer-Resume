					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Kyle and I am a web developer and executive chef from Minneapolis. With over 15 combined years in the food service industry, I have spent over half my life working with the things I love most, food and people.  I have worked almost every conceivable job in the food business, from drive-thru attendant, to dishwasher, from line cook, to the executive chef of multiple high-profile restaurants in a major North American city. I’ve seen and done it all, and learned so much along the way.  Now I know what you’re wondering: “so why the career switch into web development and software engineering?”  The short answer is my strong desire to help make the world better for all of us, but I encourage you to keep reading below.</p>
				
					<p>In December of 2019, I left an exploding chef career behind in Minneapolis.  With everything I had and a food truck, I moved to Austin and fell in love with the city immediately. Unfortunately, right as the COVID crises began, we were completely crushed, and my business partner was forced to bring the truck back to Minnesota.</p>
					
					<p>I didn’t want my time to go to waste during the crisis, and I knew I wanted to apply my life long interests in math, physics, and philosophy to good use.  It was time to use my brain for something different.  Something to help engineer the future of tomorrow.  Fortunately I found a full-stack computer programming bootcamp program at the University of Texas at Austin, and I immediately fell in love with that too. The logical structure of writing code came naturally, and it was completely beautiful to me. Now that I have graduated, I am eager to join a development or software engineering  team to apply my problem-solving and technical skills, and help shape a completely new world post COVID-19.   You will find that my skills in JavaScript and engineering MERN stack applications are just as sound as my cooking.  My leadership and ability to work with a team will also be an incredible asset.  I look forward to working with your team soon!</p>
